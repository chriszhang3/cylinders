# Code related to my [thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/177733) work

This code rules out certain cylinder diagrams and M-parallel classes using [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/) and the [surface-dynamics](https://flatsurf.github.io/surface-dynamics/index.html) package.
The primary file is `classes.ipynb`; it has also been added to [surface-dynamics](https://flatsurf.github.io/surface-dynamics/examples/rank2_genus3_classification.html).

## Dependencies

- [Instructions](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html) for installing Sage.
- After Sage is installed, you can install the surface-dynamics package with  
`sage -pip install surface-dynamics`

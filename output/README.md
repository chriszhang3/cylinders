# Code output

## Output produced by main.py

Naming convention is as follows [H]-c[j]-[k].txt, where 

*[H]* is the name of the component of stratum
*[j]* is the number of cylinders in the diagram
*[k]* is the M-parallel classes

Note that H22 refers to the component $\mathcal H^{odd}(2^2)$ otherwise it is the unique component in that stratum.

## Output produced by list.py

Naming convention is as follows [H]-c[j]-all.txt, where 

*[H]* is the name of the component of stratum
*[j]* is the number of cylinders in the diagram

## Cylinder diagrams sorted by homology relations

Naming convention is as follows c-[j]-[relation].txt, where 

*[j]* is the number of cylinders in the diagram
*[relation]* is the type of homology relation. Either pants, homologous cylinders, or other.
